# Lyft Operations & Trip Analytics Dashboard

**Primary Tools:** Power BI · DAX · Power Query  
**Data:** Synthetic / Anonymized  

---

## 1. Business Problem

Ride-hailing operations teams often lack centralized visibility into trip performance, demand patterns, and cancellation behavior across time, location, and vehicle types. Fragmented reporting makes it difficult to identify peak demand windows, revenue drivers, and operational inefficiencies impacting customer experience.

---

## 2. Objective

Build an executive-ready **Operations & Trip Analytics Dashboard** to:

- Monitor trip volume, revenue, and cancellation trends  
- Analyze demand patterns by time, location, and vehicle type  
- Identify peak hours and high-cancellation time windows  
- Enable data-driven operational and demand planning decisions  

---

## 3. Dataset Overview

- Synthetic dataset modeled on real-world ride-hailing booking data  
- Includes booking status, pickup & drop-off timestamps, locations, vehicle types, fares, and surge fees  
- Designed to support operational, time-based, and drill-through analysis  

---

## 4. KPIs & Metrics

- Completed Trips and Total Revenue  
- Average Trip Distance and Average Fare per Trip  
- Cancellation Rate (%) with driver vs customer split  
- Trips by Hour, Day of Week, and Vehicle Type  
- Peak Demand Hours and Highest Cancellation Periods  

---

## 5. Approach & Tools

- Modeled fact and dimension tables for scalable analytics  
- Built DAX measures for revenue, cancellation rates, and time-based KPIs  
- Applied Power Query transformations for data cleaning and enrichment  
- Designed slicer-driven navigation with drill-through to trip-level details  

---

## 6. Key Insights (Illustrative)

- Demand peaks during afternoon and early evening hours  
- Cancellation rates spike during early-morning time windows  
- Certain pickup locations and vehicle types drive disproportionate volume and revenue  
- Trip-level drill-through enables fast root-cause analysis  

---

## 7. Business Impact / Decisions Enabled

- Improved visibility into demand and cancellation drivers  
- Supported driver allocation and peak-hour optimization  
- Enabled leadership to monitor operational health across time, city, and vehicle dimensions
